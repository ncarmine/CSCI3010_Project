### What I planned to accomplish
> * Get the user's location
> * Fix bugs related to zooming and pins being too far away
> * Add the ability to pan and zoom around the map and query for new temperatures
> * Android version in line with iOS version: Add a timeline “scrubber” to allow the user to select temperatures hours or days ahead of the current time in Android

### What I actually accomplished
* Fix bugs related to zooming and pins being too far away
* Add the ability to pan and zoom around the map and query for new temperatures
* Add a timeline menu to allow the user to select temperatures hours and days ahead of the current time in Android

### What I would do next
* Get the user's location on Android
* Enable location search on both platforms
* Find a more efficient way to display the temperatures
* Experiment with having the time selector segmented control/menu being a slider that snaps to specific points
