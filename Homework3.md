### What I planned to accomplish
> An iOS app that displays a map centered at the user’s location that has the temperature displayed over their current city.

### What I actually accomplished
Once whether location services are enabld is determined, I accomplished what I initally set out to do. However, if location services are enabled the first time the app loads, the app does not center over the user's location (which in the simulator is San Francisco). When the app is loaded every time after the initial load, it does center over the user's location.

### What I plan to do for the next checkpoint
> Add to the map view temperatures for the ten largest surrounding cities
> Add the ability to pan and zoom around the map and query for new temperatures
> Add a timeline “scrubber” to allow the user to select temperatures hours or days ahead of the current time

I plan on maintaining this schedule.
