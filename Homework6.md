### What I planned to accomplish
> An Android app that displays a map centered at the user’s location that has the temperature displayed over their current city

> Add to the Android map view temperatures for the ten largest surrounding cities

### What I actually accomplished
* Add to the map view temperatures for five surrounding areas

### What I plan to do for the next checkpoint
* Get the user's location
* Fix bugs related to zooming and pins being too far away
* Add the ability to pan and zoom around the map and query for new temperatures
* Android version in line with iOS version: Add a timeline “scrubber” to allow the user to select temperatures hours or days ahead of the current time in Android
