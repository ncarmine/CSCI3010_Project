### What I planned to accomplish
> Basic Android App that loads json, but just displays, "Hello, World!"

### What I actually accomplished
* An Android app, written in Kotlin, that loads up a basic Map app and asynchronously fetches the DarkSky json

### What I plan to do for the next checkpoint
> An Android app that displays a map centered at the userâ€™s location that has the temperature displayed over their current city
