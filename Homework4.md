### What I planned to accomplish
> Add to the map view temperatures for the ten largest surrounding cities
> Add the ability to pan and zoom around the map and query for new temperatures
> Add a timeline “scrubber” to allow the user to select temperatures hours or days ahead of the current time

### What I actually accomplished
* Add to the map view temperatures for five surrounding areas to allow for more easy weather grabbing at any zoom level
* Add the ability to pan and zoom around the map and query for new temperatures
* A timeline selector instead of scrubber

### What I plan to do for the next checkpoint
> Basic Android App that loads json, but just displays, "Hello, World!"
